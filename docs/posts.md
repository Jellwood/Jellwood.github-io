_**HW0**: Introduction_

I am a senior at College of Charleston, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science
as well as minors in math and Russian studies. I have committed to a job
for after graduation in Columbia! In my free time, I like to play video 
games and watch Hulu. I also work part-time as a math tutor, which eats up 
a lot of time! I have been reading a book currently named _The Madonnas of
Leningrad_, which shows just how much I love Russian culture! I am also
very passionate about cooking and trying to see what new combinations I can
create. My favorite scent is chamomile and mint tea is one of my favorite 
drinks! Overall, I am very much looking forward to this semester and 
finishing up college!
