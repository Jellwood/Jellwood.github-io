Welcome to my posts page!

_**HW0**: Introduction_

I am a senior at College of Charleston, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science
as well as minors in math and Russian studies. I have committed to a job
for after graduation in Columbia! In my free time, I like to play video 
games and watch Hulu. I also work part-time as a math tutor, which eats up 
a lot of time! I have been reading a book currently named _The Madonnas of
Leningrad_, which shows just how much I love Russian culture! I am also
very passionate about cooking and trying to see what new combinations I can
create. My favorite scent is chamomile and mint tea is one of my favorite 
drinks! Overall, I am very much looking forward to this semester and 
finishing up college!  

_**HW1**: Reflections on FOSS_  
The FOSS model works as a ideal of software development where the code and development  
is shared throughout the internet and where everyone is able to see the source code.  
From this, the ideal of solving problems relies on the community at large, as opposed to  
a small group of developers in a company. Prior to Red Hat, this business model had been  
totally untried and untested, which resulted in a large impact when this model was tried  
with Linux distributions. This impact led to attempts to make this model work with  
other projects. The ultimate problem with this is that this model works when the project  
is developed with that intention in mind. Looking at how Linus Torvalds managed to create  
the initial Linux operating system, the creation of Linux utilized quick releases and  
community support to leverage bug fixes quickly and easily. In utilizing the community  
as a resource, Linus was able to generate a significant operating system by, as he put,  
"I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things other people actually  
do." From this, we can see that the idea of open source works well when the people in charge  
work to generate a model that works with this idea. Looking at other projects that do not  
fall under this umbrella of open source, it is very easy to see that not all projects work  
for this format. The question, then, posited in "The Cathedral and The Bazaar", is what  
makes this process work and how can this model can be leveraged to make projects work in  
different settings. As it was previously mentioned, the biggest way that open source  
projects are able to maintain user presence is by being active and cultivating a  
community of active users. As it was mentioned in "The Cathedral and The Bazaar," Linus  
Torvalds was able to release more than one kernel a day, implementing fixes and features  
from the user suggestions. This activity made it very clear to the users coding for these  
features that their contributions were valued by the community. Not to mention that these  
fixes and features were of a high quality because these users were committed to the project,  
highlighting how important passion is in this field of work. Open Source Projects rely on  
the knowledge that there will always be developers that develop software to be a part of  
a community and work on software that can positively impact the lives of others. As a  
result, the community thrives off of the activity of others, a fact not lost on many  
projects. A consequence of this action is that a lot of open source projects have a very  
welcoming community that pushes along the development process. The new contributors  
then become a member that will eventually welcome new members in, and they are guaranteed  
to be interested in the project due to the fact that this was entirely voluntary on  
their part. The users will eventually lost interest, but their contribution to the code  
and the community are what will inevitably remain, and their duty, as stated in "The  
Cathedral and The Bazaar," is to find a successor when they inevitably leave. This cycle  
keeps Open Source projects alive and thriving, which guarantees free and open source  
software for the world at large.
