_**HW0**: Introduction_

I am a senior at College of Charleston, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science
as well as minors in math and Russian studies. I have committed to a job
for after graduation in Columbia! In my free time, I like to play video 
games and watch Hulu. I also work part-time as a math tutor, which eats up 
a lot of time!
