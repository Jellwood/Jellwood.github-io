## Welcome to my blog!

I am a senior at College of Charleston, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science
as well as minors in math and Russian studies. I intend to go into software
engineering post-graduation, however, cybersecurity and infosec are also
two of my passions as well! This page will get updated as my projects continue!
