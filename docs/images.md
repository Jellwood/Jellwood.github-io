_**HW8**: Mythical Man-month Response_  
The Mythical Man-Month provides a potential answer for the 
burning questions surrounding software engineering. How do
managers contend with the potential issues concerning software
development. The first four chapters mention some extremely good
points with regards to how to manage a project that is behind on 
project deadlines and the steps a manager should take to either
rectify the problem or prevent the problem in the first place. In the
response, the author notes a significant problem with the idea of
staffing up in response to a deadline that has passed. In doing so,
the author challenges the idea of a man-month, the idea that a man
can do so much work in a month, and that, in increasing the amount of
man-power on a project, the project can be completed faster. While
this approach works for work that can be done asynchronously, the author
notes that there are problems with this approach in software development.
This echoes the famous saying that too many cooks spoil the broth, 
a mirror to software engineering. If the problem is that one component
does not work, adding ten more people to fix the problem will not solve
the problem because the problem can only be solved by one person.
Adding more people could never solve the problem because in the 
time that it takes to train the new people in the problem, the few people
that were previously solving the problem could have just solved it.
This presents an interesting dilemma, if there is no way to solve the
problem of going over the schedule, then how do managers deal with
the team going over the schedule? In this lies where the book begins
to deviate from an expected claim. The author claims an elite team of
engineers where one engineer is the "lead," and develops the code
mostly independently, where the head engineer is akin to a surgeon, and 
the other members of the team support them. This follows from
the idea that adding more people to a team venture will cause a 
project to slow down, then removing people would speed it up. However, 
this hierarchical structure in which only the more experienced 
engineers construct software and the younger engineers merely observe 
and check over the work. For safety-critical work, this very well may 
be the best option, however, even the author mentions that the 
younger engineers may present much more innovative solutions, which 
would be lost in this hierarchy. Not to mention, an older, more 
experienced programmer does not equate to less mistakes. In fact, an older
programmer is just as prone to mistakes as the younger one, albeit that 
an older programmer may be able to solve the issue quicker, using 
techniques that have worked for them in the past. Does this equate to
the idea that we should just leave the younger programmers behind and 
allow the older programmers to just take over? There are a variety of 
reasons why this is a bad idea, but the best solution is to have 
the older programmers mentor but allow the younger programmers to also
implement their own practices. Given that this was written in 1975, 
distributed version control systems had not been adopted in full, which
exacerbates the problem. In today's world with Git and other such version
control, it becomes much easier to trace where specific problems lay and
who is implementing this. This makes it much easier to solve these types 
of issues. Ultimately, the best solution is to create an ecosystem where
everyone is held accountable for their mistakes and implement ways to 
ensure that everyone knows their parts.  

_**HW9**: Chapter 8 and reflections on testing_  
_8.7_: A scenario that could be used for testing of the wilderness weather 
station system would be that a storm is coming into the area that the 
station is located in. The station goes into power save mode to ensure 
that the station is not without power, and reports the weather.  

_8.10_: The ethics of exhausting the testing budget is an extremely 
risky decision, especially if it is being delivered to an external 
customer. Given that budgeting decisions are rarely made at the software 
engineer level, they are given the budget to make the product. However, 
spending additional money that may not affect the final condition of the 
product is a move that is likely to decrease faith in the company. More 
time testing does not equate to a better product. Because of this, 
it is unethical to spend more money that may not affect the product after.

_Reflections_: Testing is a vital part of software engineering and 
software development. Without testing, programs that are released 
are extremely likely to have errors that would potentially result 
in death or serious injury to others. Without testing, software engineers 
have the potential to destroy society as we know it. Just as engineers 
have to get their plans approved, software engineers have the 
requirement to make sure their software is as strong as they can to ensure 
that they do not hurt people. Without proper testing, software engineers 
cannot create programs with any shred of confidence in their work.
