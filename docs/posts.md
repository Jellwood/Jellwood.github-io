Welcome to my posts page!

_**HW0**: Introduction_

I am a senior at College of Charleston, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science
as well as minors in math and Russian studies. I intend to go into software
engineering post-graduation, however, cybersecurity and infosec are also
two of my passions as well! I also enjoy gaming in my free time in addition
to playing D&D.

_**HW1**: Chapter 1_

1.3: The four essential attributes of professional software are Acceptability, Dependability, Efficiency and Maintainability. In addition, some other attributes  that are important to professional software is Scalability, Readability, Completeness, and Portability.

Scalability is important so that a solution to a problem can terminate correctly when the program experiences a problem of larger and larger sizes. Readability is important, so that any future developers can expand and reuse the code without having to decipher extensively. Completeness refers to the ability of the code to experience different types of the problem it was designed to solve without crashing or terminating incorrectly, while portability refers to the ability to move the software to multiple types of machines without sacrificing functionality.

1.8: Professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors and lawyers. The reasoning for this is that software engineers have a moral obligation to the society in which they develop software to work on projects that bring a moral good to the world. As such, a sort of license would serve as a sort of safeguard to ensure that professionals are upholding their obligation to society.

1.9: Each of the clauses of the ACM Code of Ethics will be exemplified below!

_Public:_ A software engineering firm is asked to develop software to be used in a voting machine. However, the specifications allow for an independent actor to change the vote of any vote cast with no authentication allowed. Given that voter suppression and voting fraud is inconsistent with the public interest, the firm refuses the contract and does not develop the software.

_Client and Employer:_ A software engineer works for a firm that is developing software for a hospital to track doses of medication throughout the hospital and update the hospital inventory as it does this. The software is close to release, however, there is a bug where the inventory occasionally underflows and actually shows more medicine than is available. The software engineer then acts in the best interest of the client and employer by asking for extra time to ensure that this bug gets resolved and the underflow is eliminated.

_Product:_ A software engineering firm gets a request to make a program that is capable of sorting large amounts of data that is getting inputted from multiple sources, while also displaying statistics on the dashboard as new data comes in. The team weighs multiple sorting algorithms to determine which sort would be most effective, while not sacrificing space or performance.

_Judgement:_ A team of software engineers decide to use a component that has had previous security vulnerabilities, although their previous uses has never had a breach. However, one software engineer objects and notes the security vulnerabilites and finds an alternative that does not have those vulnerabilities for the final product.

_Management:_ A manager of a software engineering team has been asking for a deadline extension on an important product, and their managers have been denying the extension. The deadline is in a week and multiple test cases are still failing, despite every engineer working around the clock on the issue. The manager elects to tell the upper management instead of lying on the test case outcomes.

_Profession:_ After releasing new software, users have been reporting an outcome that is unexpectedly crashing in some cases. The software engineering team that primarily worked on the program looks back through all of the reports and within a day, is able to push out a patch to users that fixes the issue.

_Colleagues:_ A newer software engineer joins the team and starts pitching ideas in a scrum meeting to determine the tasks and delegate each person's jobs for the day. The software engineers who have been working on the project for a significant period of time welcome the new perspective and listen attentively, which leads to a successful product.

_Self:_ A software engineer has been employed at a firm for 10 years. In 8 of those years, she has attended ACM conferences to watch presentations of research in the software engineering field.

1.10: The ethical implications of working on a system to track citizens of a country and their actions as they relate to the ACM Code of Ethics are as follows. First, the public interest is both supported and subverted by the development of this type of software. Naturally, the public interest would be served by preventing or at the least, curtailing, terrorism attacks in a country. However, the public interest is also subverted by privacy disruptions. One organization that is able to collect data on every citizen will be vulnerable to cyber attacks, and that data could be released to cause significant harm to those affected by the leaks, including citizens getting stalked, doxxed or even murdered. The ethical ramifications of being a part of this development could result in a significant boost in hate crimes in addition to the complete destruction of privacy.
