I am a senior at College of Charleston, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science
as well as minors in math and Russian studies. I currently am committed to 
a job as a technical consultant post-graduation in Columbia, and I am very 
excited to start this new chapter! I spend most of my free time in my 
room relaxing with my cat when things are relatively quiet and I love to 
try new things with cooking!
